# Weather API Project

This is a project idea from https://roadmap.sh/projects/weather-api-wrapper-service

The aim is to create a weather API that fetches and returns weather API from a 3rd 
party API.

There may be modifications as time goes on to make enhancements based on what seems
appropriate to add. The current idea is to have CLI interface that can be used to help
interact with the simple API.

## Testing Setup
Requirements:
- docker-compose

Inside of the repo directory run the command:
```
docker-compose up
```
